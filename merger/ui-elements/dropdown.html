      <h2> Drop Down</h2>
      <hr />

      <h3>Visual Specifications</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>There are two sizes for drop downs: default and small. The use of each depends on size constraints on the page. The only items that change between the default and small size drop downs are the height and the font size. </p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" src="../img/dropdown001.png"></p>
      <br clear="all"/>

      <p>Main drop down style (over white background)</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" src="../img/dropdown002.png"></p>
      <br clear="all"/>

      <p>Icons and text are centered vertically. Text: Arial 16px, #333333</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" src="../img/dropdown003.png"></p>
      <br clear="all"/>

      <p>Main drop down style (over gray background)</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" src="../img/dropdown004.png"></p>
      <br clear="all"/>

      <h4>Variation:</h4>
      <p>Font size is determined by hierarchy and the space on the page.</p>
      <p>The font color is the financial institution’s primary accent color. The drop-down arrow is provided as a vector image in the icons file. Please add the financial institution’s color to that file and save it as a .png.</p>
      <p>If the financial institution’s primary color is not available, the default text color is #333333.</p>
      <br clear="all"/>

      <br clear="all"/>

      <h3>Factors That Effect Drop Down Width</h3>
      <hr />

      <h4>Large, Med, Small</h4>
      <p>The width of the control is determined by the the location of the drop-down on the form. The minimum width of the drop-down is set by the size of the control. The drop-down control should not change its width, however there are a few use cases where the text in the control needs to be truncated or ellipsed depending on content.</p>
      <p>Ideally the control and drop-down would remain the same width as the control; longer options will wrap in the row.</p>
      <p>Exception to these rules: the drop down can be wider than the control width if the space is available - in this case the designer will need to set a max width for the large, med, and small breakpoints.</p>

      <br clear="all"/>

      <h4>XS Design</h4>
      <p>The control is a tappable row, and the drop-down menu becomes a slide panel. The same rules regarding truncation on the control and wrapping on the menu apply to the XS breakpoint.</p>
      <p>Exception to these rules: Avoid slide panels on top of slide panels in the design. In complex forms when there are many form elements, you may need to use the same drop-down control and menu that is used in the LG, MD, and S breakpoints.</p>

      <br clear="all"/>

      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>All images must have an alt attribute (even if the function of the image is purely decorative and alt=“”). When an image has meaning to a sighted user, convey this with the alt attribute if possible. Avoid images that contain text; if they do, the alt value must contain the same string of text.</p>

          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>With the Digital Insight Design System you can build custom banking applications with a consistent Digital Insight look and feel without reverse engineering our styles! It is a single underlying system that allows for a unified experience across platforms and device sizes. The system is comprised of two distinct areas with information and resources for designers and developers. Version releases will be made available whenever Digital Insight updates the user interface for its digital solutions.</p>

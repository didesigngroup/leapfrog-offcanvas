This directory contains miscellaneous design-related source files that are never accessed directly by the build process.

#### ⚠️ Please Note!

It's usually a bad idea to store large binary files in a Git repository unless you're using [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/). We've made an exception in this case for small (`< 1mb`), low-risk files.

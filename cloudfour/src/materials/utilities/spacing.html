notes: |
  Spacing utilities provide a way to apply normalized whitespace in the form of
  `margin` or `padding`. Many of the [Bootstrap 4 spacing
  utilities](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/utilities/#spacing)
  have been included in this pattern library. In addition, a few extra classes
  have been provided for responsive padding: 

  + `.p-a-responsive` adds responsive padding to all sides.
  + `.p-x-responsive` adds responsive padding to the left and right sides.
  + `.p-y-responsive` adds responsive padding to the top and bottom sides.

notes: |
  In addition to [Bootstrap's standard form control sizing
  classes](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-control-sizes), the custom
  `.input-tall-xs` component can be used to increase the height of controls for
  the smallest breakpoint. May be combined with any other sizing class.

<input class="form-control input-tall-xs" id="tallInput" placeholder="Tall in narrow viewports...">

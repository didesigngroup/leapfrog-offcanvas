  - The higher the estimated risk of uncollectable assets in the portfolio, the larger the ALLL reserve should be. The allowance is a topic of much regulatory scrutiny, and a review of the ALLL methodology is a significant portion of a financial institution’s safety and soundness exam because it is important for federal bank examiners to ensure that an institution has a sufficient amount of capital in the allowance reserve. The allowance is also significant to bank management and directors as it has a large impact on an institution’s earnings and capital.
